# Sales Prediction

In my Sales Prediction **Project of Oasis Infobyte Data Science internship**, I've dived into the dynamics of advertising spending on TV, radio, and newspaper, exploring their impact on sales prediction. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights into how advertising investments in different mediums influence sales outcomes. It's a journey into predicting sales with a focus on understanding the nuanced relationships between advertising expenditures and sales performance, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
